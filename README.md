On 1st November 2023, we had the opportunity to learn about the different components inside a computer. We also learned the procedure to disassemble the computer and reassemble it. We were also given a short quiz after the activity to test our understanding. 

# Reflection

After this activity, I have a better knowledge on the different computer parts that makes our computer functional. I also know how to disassemble and reassemble my PC which is very useful for me so that I can perform maintenance on my own computer. One suggestion that I would like to make for this activity is that we should know how to install other computer parts that is not used in this activity such as a graphics card, or a solid state drive.
